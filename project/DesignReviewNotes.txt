Take average of Hamming Distance for certain combination of Key Gates to determine best combination. Do this by finding HD for each Key (except the correct key) and taking the average.

Use XOR/XNOR gates for key insertion before MUX.
Check all combinations of possible gates and final average HD to find optimal key gate insertion. Sounds like something we should automate.
